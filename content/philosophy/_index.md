title: "My development philosophy"
---

I do believe that a philosophy-driven software development rocks any other methodology. A philosophy works for any situation a developer may encounter when designing and coding and **forces him to think** (unlike cookbook-like methodologies, e.g., clean code).

- **Clear is better than clever.**
- **Don't make things more complex than they need to be.**
- **Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.**
- **Documentation is for users.**
- **Things should be defined as close as possible to where they're used.**
- **A little copying is better than a little dependency.**

Summarizing:
> Simplicity; Try to decrease cognitive load; Do things in the most straightforward and obvious way. [^1]
