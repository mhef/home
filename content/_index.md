title: "About me"
---

I'm a software engineer coding since 2010, when I was 11. I started the journey with PHP and I've worked with a wide range of languages and technologies since then. In 2022 I finished my BS in Computer Science at [Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Vi%C3%A7osa). 

During my career I developed a variety of systems such as web, desktop and mobile applications, network load balancers and libraries. I also have a solid experience with cybersecurity, server administration and cloud infrastructure designing and deployment with CI/CD (mainly on the AWS stack, but already willing to dive in GCP). I have a special affinity about scalable and low-latency cloud applications.

In the last 2 years I've worked most with: Go, Javascript, Vue, DynamoDB and AWS. I'm always willing to advance my knowledge on any subject of the computer science.
